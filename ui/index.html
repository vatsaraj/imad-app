          There's a logo and a greetings message neatly centered. The logo is a transparent PNG file and it's made with <a href="https://www.gimp.org"GIMP</a>

          As you can see, there is a "favicon" on the left side of the tab, at the top of this page. You'll see the same icon when you access child pages of this website.
        </p>
          Below this page are THREE other pages which can be accessed by appending <b>/article1</b> or <b>/article2</b> or <b>/article3</b> to the main URL. <br>
          Alternatively you could click on
          <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="loadArticle(1)">/article1</a>,
          <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="loadArticle(2)">/article2</a>,
          <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="loadArticle(3)">/article3</a>
          to get there. The URLs are constructed using the 'location' object in JavaScript.
          <br>
          These pages are an exercise on how URL redirection works. <br>
        <p>
          Under the hood, this page is optimized for convenient view via a portable device like a mobile phone or tablet etc. Check it out in your mobile phone or tablet.
